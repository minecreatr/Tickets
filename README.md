Tickets
=======
This plugin is made for the mclovers server (mc.mclovers.org) and is not public. Please do not use this plugin on
your server without permission from me, minecreatr.

This is a basic supports ticket plugin that I am constantly working on.

Commands so far:

  {Player Command}
  /ticket [Msg] - Permission: tickets.ticket - Discription: Allows a player to create a support ticket to help with any
  issues they may have. [Msg] represents where the ticket info should go.
  
  {Player Command}
  /seeanswer - Permission: tickets.seeanswer - Description: Allows a player to see the operator response to his/her support
  ticket.
  
  {Admin/Moderator Command}
  /gettickets - Permission: tickets.gettickets - Discription: Allows an operator to view all tickets and how long ago they
  were submitted as well as the player who submitted them.
  
  {Admin/Moderator Command}
  /respond [Player] [Response] - Permission: tickets.respond - Description: Allows and operator to respond to the specified
  player with the specified message.

Additional features:
  -When you join the server and you have a ticket that has been answered the server will prompt you to execute the command
  "/seeanswer"
